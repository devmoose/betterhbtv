Better Hitbox.tv Chat Chrome Extension
--------------------------------------
Adds additional features to chat functionality on Hitbox.tv chatrooms.

Current features:
 - username highlighting


Roadmap:
 - unlimited alias/keyword highlighting
 - persistent settings (not having to re-enable timestamps/userlist on every refresh)
 - customizable highlighting colors
 - darkening the theme (similar to Better TwitchTV)


Installation:
To enable this Chrome extension, you must first download the zip file (https://github.com/devmoose/betterhbtv/archive/devmoose.zip).
Once downloaded, extract it to your computer.
Then, in Chrome, go to Settings -> Extensions and make sure you have the checkbox for "Developer Mode" checked. This will provide two buttons.
Click "Load unpacked extension...", and select the directory that you extracted the zip file to, and click OK.

Whenever you browse to a stream, the extension will automatically enable and highlight your username (currently).
